Pull-requests with bonuses changes (due to Dota Auto Chess updates) are very welcome, edit src/featuresPerks.tsx. If you want to submit PR for something else, it's safer to DM me on [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/user/Kumagor0/) first to make sure it's not something I'm already working on or am not willing to add.
